First of all, it was an amazing learning experience, I had to get my hands dirty with so many <a href=\"/tag/node-js\">Node.js</a> details and patterns and nail most of them in a relatively short timespan. Now I feel like I’m fully aware of what’s going on under the hood of Node.js and I am confident I can write pretty decent Node.js code using the right patterns for specific needs. In the second place, being a book author gave me much more visibility as a Node.js enthusiast and now I have more chances to interact with other people interested in this trending topic.</p>\n<p>If you are curious about Node.js and Design Patterns you can check out the official website of the book at: <a href=\"https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com\">https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com\"><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 405px; \"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 123.4375%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <picture>\n        <source\n          srcset=\"/static/4d6cd6dce906c960e12067418b2962fc/8d3d1/book-cover-nodejs-design-patterns-second-edition-mario-casciaro-luciano-mammino-small.webp 256w,\n/static/4d6cd6dce906c960e12067418b2962fc/ca65f/book-cover-nodejs-design-patterns-second-edition-mario-casciaro-luciano-mammino-small.webp 405w\"\n          sizes=\"(max-width: 405px) 100vw, 405px\"\n          type=\"image/webp\"\n        />\n        <source\n          srcset=\"/static/4d6cd6dce906c960e12067418b2962fc/b95e4/book-cover-nodejs-design-patterns-second-edition-mario-casciaro-luciano-mammino-small.jpg 256w,\n/static/4d6cd6dce906c960e12067418b2962fc/57c32/book-cover-nodejs-design-patterns-second-edition-mario-casciaro-luciano-mammino-small.jpg 405w\"\n          sizes=\"(max-width: 405px) 100vw, 405px\"\n          type=\"image/jpeg\"\n        />\n        <img\n          class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n          src=\"/static/4d6cd6dce906c960e12067418b2962fc/57c32/book-cover-nodejs-design-patterns-second-edition-mario-casciaro-luciano-mammino-small.jpg\"\n          alt=\"Book Cover Node.js design patterns second edition Mario Casciaro Luciano Mammino Packt Publishing\"\n          title=\"Book Cover Node.js design patterns second edition Mario Casciaro Luciano Mammino Packt Publishing\"\n          loading=\"lazy\"\n          style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        />\n      </picture>\n    </span></a></p>\n<h2 id=\"career\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#career\" aria-label=\"career permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Career</h2>\n<p>In terms of career, this October I also moved from my position of Senior PHP Developer at <em>Smartbox</em> to a new role as Senior Software Developer at <a href=\"http://planet9energy.com\">Planet9 Energy</a>. I am still pretty new in the company, but so far this change has been very exciting for a bunch of reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I get to work with a team of insanely skilled professionals like <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hughsheehy\">@hughsheehy</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tech_fort\">@tech_fort</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Podgeypoos79\">@Podgeypoos79</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/quasi_modal\">@quasi_modal</a>, Aleksandar Čambas (who doesn’t like Twitter!) and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/katavic_d\">@katavic_d</a>.

In the last 2 or 3 year I wanted to spend some time with a pure functional language but Haskell, Clojure, Lisp and other more famous language never really convinced me different reasons. Elixir, for some weird reasons, immediately catch my attention. Plus, it seems to be competing quite well with other “new-shiny” languages:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.google.com/trends/explore?date=2008-01-01%202016-12-24&#x26;q=%2Fm%2F0dsbpg6,%2Fm%2F0pl075p,%2Fm%2F03yb8hb\"><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 1000px; \"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 51.171875%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <picture>\n        <source\n          srcset=\"/static/63764dea6cc1dad6ef91bac00c252028/8d3d1/google-trend-clojure-elixir-rust-comparison.webp 256w,\n/static/63764dea6cc1dad6ef91bac00c252028/354cf/google-trend-clojure-elixir-rust-comparison.webp 512w,\n/static/63764dea6cc1dad6ef91bac00c252028/03f31/google-trend-clojure-elixir-rust-comparison.webp 1000w\"\n          sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"\n          type=\"image/webp\"\n        />\n        <source\n          srcset=\"/static/63764dea6cc1dad6ef91bac00c252028/85b06/google-trend-clojure-elixir-rust-comparison.png 256w,\n/static/63764dea6cc1dad6ef91bac00c252028/bc282/google-trend-clojure-elixir-rust-comparison.png 512w,\n/static/63764dea6cc1dad6ef91bac00c252028/da8b6/google-trend-clojure-elixir-rust-comparison.png 1000w\"\n          sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"\n          type=\"image/png\"\n        />\n        <img\n          class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n          src=\"/static/63764dea6cc1dad6ef91bac00c252028/da8b6/google-trend-clojure-elixir-rust-comparison.png\"\n          alt=\"Comparison trend Elixir, Rust and Clojure\"\n          title=\"Comparison trend Elixir, Rust and Clojure\"\n          loading=\"lazy\"\n          style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        />\n      </picture>\n    </span></a></p>\n<p>Finally I also have to admit that my friend <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bit_shark\">@bit_shark</a> had me brainwashed with “how cool Elixir is”!

There were some failures here and there and it’s good to take them into account.</p>\n<p>The first and more important failure was not being able to focus on a side project. There is a <em>kind-of-secret-project™</em> I have been working on with my great friend <a href=\"https://twitter.com/andreaman87\">@andreaman87</a>. I think I prioritised and planned really badly the time I wanted to spend on this project and I kept delaying my tasks. That’s a bit of a shame and I need to apologise with Andrea for that!</p>\n<p>Also another failure has been in my non-tech life, I haven’t been able to train Brazilian Jiu Jitsu as much as I should have done and I feel like my game and my knowledge hasn’t improved a lot! I guess I am going to keep my white belt still for a while :D</p>\n<h2 id=\"expectations-for-next-year\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#expectations-for-next-year\" aria-label=\"expectations for next year permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Expectations for next year</h2>\n<p>Ok, it’s finally time to move to the good intentions for the next year! I have been very lengthy already so I’ll just sort this part out with a simple unordered checklist, I am already looking forward to see, in one year time, how many items will be crossed:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Keep improving my knowledge of Node.js and everything related</li>\n<li>Publish the first version of my side project with Andrea</li>\n<li>Getting better with AWS and the Serverless framework</li>\n<li>Move my blog to a static publishing engine and (possibly) use a serverless hosting approach</li>\n<li>Keep investing time on Elixir and build something with it</li>\n<li>Presentations and talks in conferences and meet-ups</li>\n<li>Get more proficient with VIM (Cheers to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/quasi_modal\">@quasi_modal</a> for giving me <a href=\"https://leanpub.com/painless_vim\">an amazing book</a> as Christmas present!)</li>\n<li>Keep open sourcing stuff</li>\n<li>Travel more!</li>\n<li>More serious and constant BJJ training! 👊</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Well, That’s all… I hope I didn’t bore you to death!\nAnyway, <strong>I’d really love to know what was your biggest achievement in 2016</strong>.
