During the last 3 months I haven’t got a single minute to take care of this blog. I started a new adventure and moved to Ireland to attend the Bank of Ireland Accelerator Programme in Cork with my startup Sbaam. There I spent 3 incredible months with a huge amount of lessons learned about startups and entrepreneurship. I want to share with you 5 of the best quotes I heard from the mentors and explain what I learned from them.

This trick is pretty useful in case you have lost (or you haven’t ever had) the password of your MySql root user. You just need to throw some commands at the console.
