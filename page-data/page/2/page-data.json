You probably know already that JavaScript does not support multiple return values natively, so this article will actually explore some ways to “simulate” this behavior. One of the most famous usages of this pattern I have seen recently is within React Hooks, but before delving into that, let’s see what I mean with “multiple return values” by…","fields":{"slug":"emerging-javascript-pattern-multiple-return-values"},"frontmatter":{"date":"11 November, 2018","title":"Emerging JavaScript pattern: multiple return values","tags":["javascript","node-js","design-patterns","react","lua","go"],"header_img":{"publicURL":"/static/72bee40a6cc87cb7a4bdb3a4590c088a/emerging-javascript-pattern-multiple-return-values.jpg"}}},{"timeToRead":20,"excerpt":"In this article, I will share some of my notes and tips that might be useful if you are studying to get the AWS Solution Architect Associate Certification.
