We don’t work with Rust during our daily jobs and we come to be interested in the language for different reasons (more on this later), so we decided to take it easy and invest some of our free time reading books and tutorials, watching videos about Rust and doing occasional coding challenges. Finally after about one year of sporadic studying sessions we felt ready to attempt our first open source Rust…","fields":{"slug":"learning-rust-through-open-source-and-live-code-reviews"},"frontmatter":{"date":"11 October, 2020","title":"Learning Rust through open source and live code reviews","tags":["rust"],"header_img":{"publicURL":"/static/73964e7ee471c3ff0729c96f4bc4fb65/learning-rust-through-open-source-and-live-code-reviews.jpg"}}},{"timeToRead":4,"excerpt":"If you ended up on this article, chances are that you have been seeing JWTs (Json Web Tokens) for a while and you are curious to find out what they really are, what’s inside of them and how they actually work!

A long awaited milestone for the project. In this post we will discuss what middy is and what are the main features of this first stable release. What is middy If you are hearing about middy for the first time, middy is a middleware framework for AWS Lambda written in Node.js. Middy has the goal to simplify the way you write Lambda code, essentially by providing a convenient middleware abstraction (similar to the ones…","fields":{"slug":"middy-1-is-here"},"frontmatter":{"date":"26 April, 2020","title":"Middy 1.0.0 is here","tags":["serverless","node-js","javascript"],"header_img":{"publicURL":"/static/911e2960b0446b11607c8d68c2813b85/loige-co-middy-1-is-here.jpg"}}},{"timeToRead":10,"excerpt":"A little bit later than I expected over the new year, but here we are again, with my usual introspective post to figure out how the hell did the last year went and how to make the best out of the new year.

I personally believe that this is also a consequence of the “many small modules” philosophy that has been popularised within the JavaScript ecosystem. This is great, but all that glitters is not gold… Look, for instance, at this picture for a second:  Yeah…","fields":{"slug":"lean-npm-packages"},"frontmatter":{"date":"08 September, 2019","title":"Lean NPM packages","tags":["javascript","node-js","npm"],"header_img":{"publicURL":"/static/2c6b16403f5bc00909676e8ddf0cb9e8/lean-npm-packages.jpg"}}},{"timeToRead":12,"excerpt":"In this article I will show my setup to build and share web apps prototypes using Fastify and Preact, two technologies that I love. I will also use htm, a library that can be easily integrated with Preact to define DOM elements in a very expressive and react-like way (like JSX), without having to use transpilers like Babel. Finally we will see how to dockerize a sample app built with this setup. This will make the app easy to share with co-workers and friends.
